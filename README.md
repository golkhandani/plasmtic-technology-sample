# Running system locally using localstack

Run localstack using docker compose (or you can install it locally)
For more information about localstack look at the the [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)

```
$ docker-compose up
```

Setup credential in localstack environment and then set them in .env file located at root of the project!

# Running system locally using local-serverless-plugins

To install and run dynamoDB locally

Add following line to serverless configuration file

```
custom:
  dynamodb:
    stages:
      - test
```

```
$ npm install --save-dev serverless-dynamodb-local

$ serverless dynamodb start --migrate --inMemory --stage test 
```


To install and run s3 locally 

Add following line to serverless configuration file
```
resoureces:
  Resources:
    ...
    FileStorage:
      Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
      Properties:
      BucketName: bucket-name

s3:
  host: localhost
  directory: /tmp
```

```
$ npm install --save-dev serverless-s3-local
```




# Run serverless locally
To Run Service as standalone server
```
serverless offline
```

# Deploy serverless app on AWS

First config the AWS CLI using serverless CLI by running below command:

```
$ serverless config credentials --provider aws --key ***key*** --secret ***secret***
```

Then to deploy application on server:

```
$ serverless deploy --stage production --region eu-west-1 --verbose --force
```



# Before Deploying the Application

You have to create a user with needed permissions on AWS


### Fixing Upload File (Reading Binary)


1. Go to the API Gateway settings tab for your API and add multipart/form-data to the binary media types section.
2. Add Content-Type and Accept to the request headers for your proxy method
3. Add those same headers to the integration request headers
4. Re-deploy the API
